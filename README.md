### Hi There ðŸ‘‹ I am Ipsita Panda.

#### About Me
I am an accomplished Product Manager , currently leading a team at Boston Scientific to define requirements for the EMEA revenue management system. In my previous role as a Digital Acceleration PMO at Mars, I translated business goals into product requirements for B2C e-commerce platforms across Europe and APAC. During my time as a Consultant at KPMG, I conducted extensive market research and generated insightful reports on RPA and automation in finance. At Shell, I served as a Product Owner, where I led agile projects, achieved substantial cost savings through cloud migration, and boosted user adoption with innovative solutions. My career also includes roles as a Senior Business Consultant at Accenture, Team Leader at Cargill, and Business Consultant at Publicis Sapient, where I led data migration efforts, designed tailored business requirements, and facilitated workshops. My diverse experience across industries and geographies underscores my expertise in product management and business strategy.
